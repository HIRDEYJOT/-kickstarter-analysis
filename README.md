PERFORMING ANALYSIS TO KICKSTARTER DATA TO UNCOVER TRENDS

# Overview of Project
Louiseâ€™s wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. So by using excel we are helping her to have an easy visualization and track all the data in form of charts and tables by filtering data and applying equations to make a clear image of her project. 

# Analysis And Challanges
## Analysis: 
Analysis of the project is done in few different steps

**1. Analyzing the Data provided::**
 In this step we Filtered the Data and formated it in order to get right results and proper visualization. 
 
**2. Errors and Debugging::**
 In this step we sorted all the erroes occured and debugged it for correct visulization.

**3. Charting the data::**
 After applying all the filters to the data and sorting it , we plotted some charts to make a visual representation of what is happening with the campaign and covered all the success and failures. We also created new data sheets where it is easy to look up the required set of data and made it easier to analyze the Outcomes.

## Challanges: 
The main challange was to filter the right set of data which covered all the campaigns. Then some challanges were faced while debugging all the errors. To select right values for pivot tables and plot the right chart which gives proper visualization of the data set was another challange faced 

# Results:
We have pivot tables for all the outcomes based on the launch date and Theater outcomes based on the launch date.

We have pivot table and chart for Outcomes based on goals.

With the help of pivot tables and charts it is easy to visualize the data and analyse the successes and thye failiurs.
We can also sort the data according to our specification and get easy quick results of tables and charts.


## Limitations::
Some of the Limitations are we lack the data of the campaigns which are still going live. 
We can also need to make new tables and chart for the remaining outcomes so that she can choose the campaign according to time and cause.
